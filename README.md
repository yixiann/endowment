# Endowment Plan ðŸ’¸

This was one of my first coding projects.

There was once a financial advisor who was trying to convince me that his/her company was selling the best endowment plan out there.

The usual me would use Excel to do some analysis.

BUT WAIT! I remember that I can code now! So I decided to use visx to display and analyse the data. Taking into consideration the expected returns, my outlook on market performance, and when I might surrender the plan, I decided on... it's a secret :D
